### General Info
***
This's a Compiler theory project for the year 2022 at the Faculty of Computers and Information, Ain Shams

Under the supervision Dr, Sally Saad

This project contains two main parts

#### First part
***
The scanner part, in this part we explored the Tiny language to for the extraction of Lexical words

So first we made the regular expression for the tokens then convert it into NFA & DFA

Then we created the the code part pased on this RE & DFA to be ready for second part

#### Second part
***
The parser part, in this part we toke the Tokens that we created and gathered from scanner part and use it to create a parse tree

First we made CFG for the tiny language that describe the grammer (syntax) then we removed the ambiguity for grammar

Then covered this grammar to code using a Top-Down parser, A top-down parser builds the parse tree from the top to down, starting with the start non-terminal using leftmost parsing
